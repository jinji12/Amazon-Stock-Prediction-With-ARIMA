# Amazon Stock Prediction with ARIMA

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting Amazon's adjusted close prices for the next three days using the ARIMA model. We compare the results obtained from training the model on one year's data versus all available historical data.

## Usage

To run the model:

1. Upload the provided source code to Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebooks-supported code editor.
2. Execute the code to observe the ARIMA model's predictions.

## Future Plans

- **Data Splitting:** Implement an 80/20 split for training and testing sets.
- **Grid Search:** Explore optimal p, d, q values using split data for the ARIMA model to enhance accuracy.
